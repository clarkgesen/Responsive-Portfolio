        <!-- About me -->
        <p>
            I am a 25 year old student in a web development bootcamp. I am proficient in java, and I am learning html, css, and javascript.
            I have worked as a pro shop attendant and cook at a golf course, as a camp counselor, as a lifeguard, and most recently as a photographer and social media manager at a summer camp. I enjoy watching sports, mostly the New England Patriots and Boston Celtics, but I enjoy all Boston sports teams. I also enjoy playing sports, golf mostly, but I also enjoy skiing. I also enjoy flying my drone and taking photos and videos with it.
